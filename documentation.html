  <p>The Movies API is a server-side application that provides users with access to a database of movies, directors, and genres. This RESTful API allows users to sign up, update their personal information, and manage a list of their favorite movies. The API supports CRUD operations, enabling users to retrieve detailed movie information, explore different genres and directors, and personalize their movie lists. Built using Node.js and Express, the Movies API ensures secure authentication and efficient data handling to enhance the user experience.</p>
